- what is cybersecurity? <br>
  Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes. Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative
- What are the common cyberattacks?
 Below are some of the most common types of cyber-attacks:
👉 Malware.
👉 Phishing.
👉 Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM)
👉 Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack.
👉 SQL injection.
👉 Zero-day exploit.

- Difference between ifconfig &ipconfig?
- What is data encapsulation in networking? <br>
  Encapsulation is the process of adding additional information when data is traveling in OSI or TCP/IP model. The additional information has been added on sender's      side, starting from Application layer to Physical layer
- What are black box and white box testing?
- How is encryption is different from hashing?
   encryption is two-way, the data can be decrypted so it is readable again. Hashing, on the other hand, is one-way, meaning the plaintext is scrambled into a unique        digest, through the use of a salt, that cannot be decrypted.
- What is a three way handshake?
- Explain SSL Encryption.
  SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer and, in short, it's the standard technology for keeping an internet connection secure and safeguarding any sensitive data that is    being sent between two systems, preventing criminals from reading and modifying any information transferred, including potential personal details.<br>
   Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is a security protocol that is used for the purpose of encryption. It ensures privacy, data integrity, and authentication in the network like   online transactions.<br><br>
  Following are the steps for setting up an SSL encryption: 
  - A browser connects to an SSL-secured web server. 
  - The browser requests the server’s public key in exchange for its own private key. 
  - If it is trustworthy, the browser requests to establish an encrypted connection with the web server. 
  - The web server sends the acknowledgment to start an SSL encrypted connection. 
  - SSL communication starts to take place between the browser and the web server.

# VAPT Interview Questions

- What do you mean by security testing?
   Security testing is a process intended to reveal flaws in the security mechanisms of an information system that protect data and maintain functionality as intended.
- What do you mean by vulnerability?
   Vulnerability is the inability to resist a hazard or to respond when a disaster has occurred. 
- What do you mean by penetration testing?
   A penetration test (pen test) is an authorized simulated attack performed on a computer system to evaluate its security.
- What are the two prevalent techniques used to safeguard a password file?
- What are the major attributes of security testing?
   Normally, security testing has the following attributes:
 👉 Authentication.
 👉 Authorization.
 👉 Confidentiality.
 👉 Availability.
 👉 Integrity.
 👉 Non-repudiation.
- What is the importance of VAPT?
  VAPT helps to protect your organisation by providing visibility of security weaknesses and guidance to address them.
