- what is cybersecurity? <br>
  Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes. Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative
- What are the common cyberattacks?
 Below are some of the most common types of cyber-attacks:
üëâ Malware.
üëâ Phishing.
üëâ Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM)
üëâ Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack.
üëâ SQL injection.
üëâ Zero-day exploit.

- Difference between ifconfig &ipconfig?
- What is data encapsulation in networking? <br>
  Encapsulation is the process of adding additional information when data is traveling in OSI or TCP/IP model. The additional information has been added on sender's      side, starting from Application layer to Physical layer
- What are black box and white box testing?
- How is encryption is different from hashing?
   encryption is two-way, the data can be decrypted so it is readable again. Hashing, on the other hand, is one-way, meaning the plaintext is scrambled into a unique        digest, through the use of a salt, that cannot be decrypted.
- What is a three way handshake?
- Explain SSL Encryption.
  SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer and, in short, it's the standard technology for keeping an internet connection secure and safeguarding any sensitive data that is    being sent between two systems, preventing criminals from reading and modifying any information transferred, including potential personal details.<br>
   Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is a security protocol that is used for the purpose of encryption. It ensures privacy, data integrity, and authentication in the network like   online transactions.<br><br>
  Following are the steps for setting up an SSL encryption: 
  - A browser connects to an SSL-secured web server. 
  - The browser requests the server‚Äôs public key in exchange for its own private key. 
  - If it is trustworthy, the browser requests to establish an encrypted connection with the web server. 
  - The web server sends the acknowledgment to start an SSL encrypted connection. 
  - SSL communication starts to take place between the browser and the web server.

# VAPT Interview Questions

- What do you mean by security testing?
   Security testing is a process intended to reveal flaws in the security mechanisms of an information system that protect data and maintain functionality as intended.
- What do you mean by vulnerability?
   Vulnerability is the inability to resist a hazard or to respond when a disaster has occurred. 
- What do you mean by penetration testing?
   A penetration test (pen test) is an authorized simulated attack performed on a computer system to evaluate its security.
- What are the two prevalent techniques used to safeguard a password file?
- What are the major attributes of security testing?
   Normally, security testing has the following attributes:
 üëâ Authentication.
 üëâ Authorization.
 üëâ Confidentiality.
 üëâ Availability.
 üëâ Integrity.
 üëâ Non-repudiation.
- What is the importance of VAPT?
  VAPT helps to protect your organisation by providing visibility of security weaknesses and guidance to address them.
- As a developer, what will you do to rectify existing cross-site scripting vulnerability in the code that the application security auditors have reported?
- What do you know about WSDL and SOAP?
 SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a message protocol that enables the distributed elements of an application to communicate. SOAP can be carried over a variety   of standard protocols, including the web-related Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

## DevOps Interview Questions

- What do you know about DevOps?
  DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at high            velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes.
- What is the role of AWS in DevOps?
  AWS provides services that help you practice DevOps at your company and that are built first for use with AWS. These tools automate manual tasks, help teams manage      complex environments at scale, and keep engineers in control of the high velocity that is enabled by DevOps.
- How is DevOps different from agile methodology?
   DevOps is a culture, fostering collaboration amongst all participants involved in the development and maintenance of software. Agile can be described as a             development methodology designed to maintain productivity and drive releases with the common reality of changing needs.
- What are the different phases in DevOps?
 DevOps follows certain processes that include code, build, test, release, deploy, operate, monitor and plan. DevOps lifecycle follows various phases such as   continuous development, integration, testing, continuous monitoring, and continuous feedback.
- How will you approach a project that needs to implement DevOps?
- What is the difference between continuous delivery and continuous deployment?
  Continuous Delivery (CD): CI + the entire software release process is automated, it may be composed of multiple stages, and deployment to production is manual.         Continuous Deployment: CI + CD + fully automated deployment to production.
- What is the role of configuration management in DevOps?
  Configuration management is important because it enables the ability to scale infrastructure and software systems without having to correspondingly scale                 administrative staff to manage those systems. This can make it possible to scale where it previously wasn't feasible to do so.
