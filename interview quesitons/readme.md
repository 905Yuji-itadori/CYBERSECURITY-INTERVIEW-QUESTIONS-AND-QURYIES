- what is cybersecurity? <br>
  Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes. Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative

- Difference between ifconfig &ipconfig?
- What is data encapsulation in networking? <br>
  Encapsulation is the process of adding additional information when data is traveling in OSI or TCP/IP model. The additional information has been added on sender's      side, starting from Application layer to Physical layer
- What are black box and white box testing?
- How is encryption is different from hashing?
- What is a three way handshake?
- Explain SSL Encryption. <br>
  Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is a security protocol that is used for the purpose of encryption. It ensures privacy, data integrity, and authentication in the network like   online transactions.<br><br>
  Following are the steps for setting up an SSL encryption: 
  - A browser connects to an SSL-secured web server. 
  - The browser requests the serverâ€™s public key in exchange for its own private key. 
  - If it is trustworthy, the browser requests to establish an encrypted connection with the web server. 
  - The web server sends the acknowledgment to start an SSL encrypted connection. 
  - SSL communication starts to take place between the browser and the web server.
